# Post-COVID Airline Recovery Analysis (2019–2025)

## Overview
This project analyzes the post-COVID recovery of major **Indian** and **Gulf** airlines using **2019 as the baseline year (Index = 100)**.  
The objective is to compare recovery speed, strength, and structural drivers across regions using financial and operational indicators.

The analysis focuses on how **network structure (domestic vs international exposure)** influenced recovery outcomes rather than airline size alone.

## Airlines Covered
**Indian Airlines**
- IndiGo  
- Air India  
- SpiceJet  

**Gulf Airlines**
- Emirates  
- Qatar Airways  
- Etihad Airways  

---

## Time Period
- **Baseline year:** 2019 (Pre-COVID)  
- **Recovery period:** 2020–2025 (latest available data / reasonable estimates)

---

## Methodology
- 2019 is fixed as the baseline (**Index = 100**) for all metrics.
- Individual recovery indices were calculated for:
  - Passenger traffic
  - Revenue
  - Fleet size
- A **Composite Recovery Index** was computed as the average of the above indices to enable airline-to-airline and region-to-region comparison.
- All financial figures were normalized to USD to ensure comparability across regions.

---

## Data Sources & Assumptions
- Data was **manually researched and compiled** from publicly available sources, including:
  - Airline annual reports
  - Investor presentations
  - Official airline disclosures
  - Industry and regulatory publications
- The dataset was **self-constructed** by consolidating information from multiple sources rather than downloaded from a single database.
- Where exact figures were not publicly disclosed, **reasonable estimates** were used and applied consistently across airlines to preserve analytical comparability.
- Indian airline financials reported in INR were converted to USD using a fixed project exchange rate.
- Gulf airline currencies (AED and QAR) were treated using their official USD pegs.
- Differences in fiscal year (FY vs calendar year) reporting were noted and normalized where required.

---

## Key Insights
- Indian airlines recovered faster overall due to early normalization of domestic travel demand.
- Gulf carriers experienced delayed recovery because of heavy reliance on international and long-haul traffic.
- IndiGo emerged as the strongest Indian performer due to scale, cost efficiency, and domestic network strength.
- Qatar Airways outperformed Gulf peers post-2022, supported by rapid international network restoration.
- Recovery speed was driven more by **market structure** than airline size.
